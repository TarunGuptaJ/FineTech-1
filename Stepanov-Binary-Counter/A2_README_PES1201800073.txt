Fine Techniques Assignment 2: Write-Up

Data Structure:
The datastructure that was used for this is the adjacency list that can be explained as a coupling of an array
of pointers to nodes, and a linked list. That is array of linked lists. 
The node (Struct node) contains:
    1.An int variable named data for storing the value
    2.A self referential pointer that is used for pointing to the next element in the linked list or if the 
    value is NULL it signifies the end of the linked list in that array. 

Basic Logic: 
The end result of the implementation is that it should find the second greatest element in log n + n -2 comparisons.
The basic idea is to obtain the list of all elements that lost to the greatest element of the given array and to 
iterate through the entirety of the list of elements that lost to the greatest element and returning the maximum of
the corresponding list. 

The math.h module has been utilized and it needs to be compiled with the -lm flag, because of the requirement to 
calculate the log2 and ceil to obtain the length of the array of structure pointers for the adjacency list.

Key Takeaway:
Obtained a clearer view in advantages and disadvantages of using adjacency list over matrices and vice versa.
Mapping the working of the implementation before coding speeds up the process.
