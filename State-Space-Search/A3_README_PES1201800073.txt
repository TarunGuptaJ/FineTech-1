Assignment 3
Data Structure Used:
    1. Utilized the doubly linked list for the implementation of the given Assignment. The reason for using Doubly linked list
    is easy access of the previous node instead of traversing till the end everytime we want to delete the last node.

    2. Used an array of functions that was used for implementing backtracking, each node has a function index that holds information
    about the last function that was applied and everytime an invalid state was encountered we go to the last node and increment the 
    function index accordingly in order to arrive at the solution

How to compile your code:
    No special external header files used
    Folder structure for compilation
    Folder
        --A3_client_PES1201800073.c
        --A3_header_PES1201800073.c
        --A3_impl_PES1201800073.c
    gcc A3_impl_PES1201800073.c A3_client_PES1201800073.c
    a.exe < input.txt   

Key Takeaway:
    1. Accomplishing backtracking with explicit stack instead of recursion.
    2. Understood the actual requirement for writing code across mutliple files.
    3. Debugging errors across all files.
